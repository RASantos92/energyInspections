                            energy codes an important part of creating a sustainable future. In fact, according
                            to
                            the
                            U.S. Department of Energy, nearly 40% of the nation’s energy is consumed by
                            buildings.
                            It is
                            important to add new or update older building codes for the future. Check out the

                            five

                            <p>Energy codes save money by reducing the needless consumption of energy used to
                                heat,
                                cool,
                                light, ventilate, and provide hot water for buildings. Consumers can use the

                            <p>Buildings use a large amount of energy. As a result, they create emissions.

                                codes help
                                to protect the natural environment from unnecessary emissions. Some examples
                                include
                                pollution and gas house emissions. In fact, according to the U.S. Department of

                                2030, 800 million metric tons of Co2 will be saved as a result of codes.</p>
